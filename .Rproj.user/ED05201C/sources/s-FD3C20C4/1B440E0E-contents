Grazing can change plant community structure and composition by removing and trampling aboveground biomass and changing photosynthetic capacity, growth rates, and competitive dynamics of plants. Grazing that is meant to benefit vegetation communities in California is often focused on reducing thatch, slowing or reversing successional trajectories, and increasing species and functional diversity, such as perennial grasses. Managers typically control the timing and intensity of grazing to achieve these goals.

Absolute cover with invasives as a functional group
