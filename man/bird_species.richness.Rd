\title{Create a Species Richness per Point Graph}
\usage{
bird_species.richness(df, transect = c(levels(as.factor(df$Transect))),
  surveyyear = c(levels(as.factor(df$YEAR))))
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame object. Only will take newpc2 which is created by:  add.zero() , bird_prepare(). See those functions for additional previous steps.}

\item{transect}{A ranch code or a list of ranch codes ie."TOKA".}

\item{surveyyear}{A year or multiple years. ie. c(2016,2018)}
}
\value{
A graph that summerises species richness of each bird species per point and year.
}
\description{
Takes bird data that has been prepared by bird_prepare function and add.zero function to create a species richness per point graph based on ranch transect and surveyyear.
}
\examples{
data = bird_species.richness(newpc2, "TOKA", 2016)

}
