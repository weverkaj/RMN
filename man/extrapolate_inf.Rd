\title{Extrapolate Infiltration Time}
\usage{
extrapolate_inf(height, time = 45)
}
\arguments{
\item{height}{height of water remaining in infiltration ring}

\item{time}{time that infiltration was stopped. Default is 45. Time is in decimal units so 47:30 would be 47.5}
}
\value{
Extrapolated time of Infiltration
}
\description{
For infiltration tests that were stopped before completely finishing, this funtion uses the remaining depth (cm) and the run time (minutes) of the test to extrapolate the time of a complete infiltration.
}
\examples{
extrapolate_inf(1.5, 50)
