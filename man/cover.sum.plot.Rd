\arguments{
\item{lpi}{A dataframe object of lpi data from a veg survey}

\item{releve}{A dataframe object of releve data from a veg survey}

\item{transect}{Ranch for which to make the plot}

\item{surveyyear}{The years for which to make the table}

\item{choose.variable}{Character vector that identifies which variables to summarize. See cover.summary()}

\item{multiple_years}{Boolean that determines whether multiple years of data are plotted. if FALSE, only most recent year is plotted}

\item{barcolors}{Character vector of bar fill colors for each year of data}

\item{legend}{Boolean that specifies whether to display a legend}

\item{legendname}{A title for your legend}

\item{xlab, ylab}{Labels for axes}

\item{xangle}{Angle to display point names on x axis}

\item{plot.name}{Character vector of names of plots. If choose.variable is manually changed, then plot.names also needs to be changed.}

\description{
For veg data, plots cover of shrubs, trees, litter, thatch, bare ground for each year in which data were collected.

Tree and shrub covers come from releve estimates.

NOTE: Thatch was only measured starting in 2017.

\examples{
data = cover.sum.plot(lpi, checklist)
