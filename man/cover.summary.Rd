\title{Create cover summary table for veg data}
\usage{
cover.summary(lpi, releve, transect,
  surveyyear = c(levels(as.factor(lpi$year)),
  levels(as.factor(releve$year))), choose.variable = c("SpeciesRichness",
  "Litter", "Thatch", "BareGround", "Trees", "Shrubs"), rounded = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lpi}{A dataframe object of lpi data from a veg survey}

\item{releve}{A dataframe object of releve data from a veg survey}

\item{transect}{The ranch for which to make the summary}

\item{surveyyear}{The years for which to make the summary}

\item{choose.variable}{Character vector that identifies which variables to summarize. Defaults to Species Richness, Litter, Thatch, Bare Ground, Trees, and Shrubs}

\item{rounded}{Boolean whether to round values in table}
}
\value{
A summary of cover
